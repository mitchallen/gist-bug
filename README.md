There was a bug where code indented in a GIST was not displaying correctly in Safari.

After I edited the code directly in the GIST editor the code looked better, even though all I did was add or remove lines.

If you see such an error, try just adding a line or something in the GIST editor, refresh the browser where you embedded the GIST and see if fixes itself.

If you still see the problem, clone this repo and paste in your own GIST embed code to test it.
